3¬∫ - now just run:  yarn test
```

PS: was my first test created until now, tips are welcome.

<h3>The good news</h3> <p>is the data I passed  manually worked as you can see above.</p>

 <h3>the bad news</h3>
As you already know, was my first test and I had a problem let's explain:
<br/>
<p>when you run for the first time <b>yarn test</b> the script will run and create the database, and this database does not "clean" automatically, so if you run again will show some-problems because the datas was already created before. I've searching for solve this issue but unfortunately I not find yet, if you know how to solve <a href="https://github.com/mateusamarall/Notes/issues"> Contributions</a> are welcome and I'll still working for solve this. the second "problem" is about the creating fakes users, I had a problem using so I decided not use it, until find a way to solve.</p>
